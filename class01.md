# Week 1, Day 1 (exciting!) : Tuesday, 01/11/22

Takeaways from Leon's speech at the beginning:

- Learning to code is only a small part of getting a job in software development.
- Once you can, don't forget to give back.
- Just because the program is free in money it doesn't mean it's free in time.
- The class is focused on web development.

## Agenda for the day:
#### - Software engineering as a career?
#### - Learn - Course Setup
#### - How to Learn

Software Engineer Salaries average at 92k per year salary.
Supposedly one of the happiest careers.

Learning to code is not the only thing that will give you a job.

Learn how to network!
Learn how to differentiate yourself in the market.
#### Learn JavaScript!!!
Don't smell.

Manage frustration
Be consistent
Take care of yourself

-Creating good habits on studying will help. Being consistent. Outside of class you
 should be expecting to spend 10-20 hours. Try to break up the work into as many
 sections as possible, 1-2 hours a day is enough to do good in the boot camp.

 You are committing to studying at least 1-2 hours per day, every day of the week.

 Most people burn out. DON'T BURN OUT!
 Don't waste your awesome privilege of time to study.

## Learning How to Learn

Notes are not as good as they seem. There is a better way to learn. This can be done
via two things:

- Active Recall [link for YouTube video]
- Space Repetition [link for YouTube video]

Don't take notes, take questions.

"What is a study practice that can save me a ton of time and effort on Learning?"

Use AnkiWeb for cards. Write your own cards, writing these questions is an active
recall session on its own. Use Anki everyday.

Get comfortable with space repetition!
