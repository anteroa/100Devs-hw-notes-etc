//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = ['Pulp Fiction', 'Django', 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas']
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let sick = movies[0]
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let len  = movies.length
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let lastElement = movies[len-1]
